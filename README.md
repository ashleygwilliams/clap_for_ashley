clap_for_ashley
===============
This is a private repo, for only BK-000 students. Only contributors can see it and only students in our class will be contributors. Please keep it a secret from Ashley until we launch it! Just let me know if you want to contribute. This will be our gift to her. :)

The idea of the site is that it will have a stream of her tweets, and each time a new tweet comes in the sound of applause will play, and we'll randomize an image of students clapping.

Let me know if you have any other ideas for the site! Let's make this awesome!
